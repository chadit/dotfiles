* look into neotest, if it works better then just plain dap

errors: 
* ssh nvim, clipboard error fixed by using tmux as the wrapper. when in tmux, vim/nvim will use the tmux buffer.
* if live_grep is not working, check that ripgrep is preinstalled.  if not, install it.


enhancements
-- the use case is where a company has a repo for addons that are used but they are older versions 
-- and we want the new versions.
-- goal is also to avoid package managers as much as possible.

* add a repo updating that works like go and rust.
* checks if the folder exist, if not create and clone the repo.
* if there is a build command, run it.
* if there is a post build command, run it. (example move the binary to /usr/local/bin)
