* add search functionality into a file.  example, search for all functions test() in all files
* add support to show buffers like tabs, similar to vscode
* look into neotest, if it works better then just plain dap

errors: 
* ssh nvim, clipboard error fixed by using tmux as the wrapper. when in tmux, vim/nvim will use the tmux buffer.
